# Firefly

------

Lightweight thrift client code generator and runtime library for Android and Java.

Code generated by firefly has much fewer methods(about 1%) and lines than standard thrift code, which helps applications avoid the notorious 64k limit on methods in Android applications.

Firefly has an acceptable performance. Local process takes several tens of milliseconds when cold booting a service, which thrift code takes several milliseconds. Hot call takes less than one millisecond almost as fast as thrift code. Anyway, the time taken by local process is ignorable, comparing to the time taken by network.

This project is inspired by Square's [wire](https://github.com/square/wire) and [retrofit](https://github.com/square/retrofit), and I shamelessly copy a lot of code from Twitter's [scrooge](https://github.com/twitter/scrooge) and Google's [gson](https://github.com/google/gson).

## Compiling thrift files
Preparation:

* clone this repository
* install sbt
 
To compile thrift files:

```bash
$ sbt 'generator/run [--output <output-dir>] <thrift-file1> [<thrift-file2> ...]'
```

The generator assumes that thrift files included by the target thrift file are placed in the same dir of the target thrift file. 

## Using Firefly in your application
The `library` package contains runtime support libraries that must be included in applications that use Firefly-generated code.

Include via Maven:

```xml
<dependency>
  <groupId>com.meituan.firefly</groupId>
  <artifactId>library</artifactId>
  <version>0.1</version>
</dependency>
```

or Gradle:

```groovy
compile 'com.meituan.firefly:library:0.1'
```

Given the following thrift file for example:

```
namespace java com.meituan.greeting
service GreetingService{
    string greet(string name);
}
```

It generates an interface named `GreetingService`.

Use of generated code:

```Java
Thrift thrift = new Thrift();
final OkHttpClient okhttpClient = new OkHttpClient();
 
GreetingService greetingService = thrift.create(GreetingService.class, new SimpleProtocolFactory(){
    @Override
    public TProtocol get() {
        return new TBinaryProtocol(new OkhttpTransport(YOUR_SERVICE_URL, okhttpClient));
    }
};

String greeting = greetingService.greet("Han meimei");
```

The `Thrift` object caches services that it creates, keeping it as an singleton can improve performance.

Make sure that `ProtocolFactory.get()` return a new Protocol for each call, or return a same thread-safe Protocol for every call.
