# Firefly
-------

Lightweight thrift client code generator and runtime library for Android and Java.

Code generated by firefly has much fewer methods(about 1%) and lines than standard thrift code, which helps applications avoid the notorious 64k limit on methods in Android applications.

Firefly has a acceptable performance. Local process takes several tens of milliseconds when cold booting a service, which thrift code takes several milliseconds. Hot call takes less than one millisecond almost as fast as thrift code. Anyway, the time taken by local process is ignorable, comparing to the time taken by network.

This project is inspired by Square's [wire](https://github.com/square/wire) and [retrofit](https://github.com/square/retrofit), and I copy a lot of code from Twitter's [scrooge](https://github.com/twitter/scrooge) and Google's [gson](https://github.com/google/gson).
